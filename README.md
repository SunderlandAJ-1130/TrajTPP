This repository includes the source codes and experiment results of our current manuscript submitted to IEEE Internet of Things (IoTJ), "Inquiring the next location and travel time: a deep learning based temporal point process for vehicle trajectory prediction". 

Here, "evaluation - geolife - 5.ipynb" and "./log/" show its prediction performance on the open-source benchmark in [^1].
